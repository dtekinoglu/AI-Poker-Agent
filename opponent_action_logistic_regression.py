# consists of four components:
# 1. The private cards visible to the player.
# 2. The community cards visible to both player and opponent.
# 3. The current bet placed by you and
# 4. The current bet placed by the opponent.
# 5. This one is not listed in the instruction but also should be considered: how much money the opponent have (sum to 20000)
